# Design Patterns with TypeScript

This repository contains **practical implementations of software design patterns using TypeScript**, with a strong focus on **clean code**, **real-world use cases**, and **scalable application design**.

The goal is not just to demonstrate how patterns work, but **when and why they should be used** — and just as importantly, **when they should NOT**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Deepen understanding of classic design patterns
- Apply patterns using modern TypeScript
- Practice writing clean, maintainable code
- Build a solid reference for real-world projects
- Serve as a personal study and portfolio repository
